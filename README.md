# CarInsuranceCostPredictor
This is a group project by Prodromos Avramidis, Chara Tsirka and Georgios Gerontidis for the data mining course. We applied machine learning models on a dataset obtained from a car insurance company in order to predict the insurance premium for a given customer. Then we created an app in which you can input all your information and a prediction for you insurance premium cost will be made.
